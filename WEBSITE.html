  club based in Madrid, that plays in La Liga. In terms of UEFA competition titles won, Atletico Madrid is Spain's third
  most successful club behind Real Madrid and Barcelona. In terms of the number of titles, Atletico Madrid is third most
  successful club in Spanish football, behind Real Madrid, Barcelona. Atletico have won La Liga on ten occasions, including
  a league and cup double in 1996; the Copa del Rey on ten occasions; two Supercopas de Espana and one Copa Eva Duarte; in
  Europe, they won the European Cup Winners' Cup in 1962, were runners-up in 1963 and 1986, were European Cup runners-up in
  1974, 2014 and 2016, won the Europa League in 2010 and in 2012, won the UEFA Super Cup in 2010 and 2012, as well as the 1974
  Intercontinental Cup. The club play their home games at the Vicente Calderon, which holds up to 54,960 spectators. In 2016,
  Atletico are due to move to their new home of Estadio La Peineta, which will have a capacity of 70,000. Atletico's home kit
  is red and white vertical striped shirts, with blue shorts, accompanied by blue and red socks. This combination has been used
  since 1911. During their history the club has been known by a number of nicknames, including Los Colchoneros ("The Mattress
  Makers"), due to their first team stripes being the same colours as old-fashioned mattresses. During the 1970s, they became
  known as Los Indios, allegedly due to the club signing several South American players after the restrictions on signing foreign
  players were lifted. However, there are a number of alternative theories which claim they were named so because their stadium is
  "camped" on the river bank, or because Los Indios (The Indians) were the traditional enemy of Los Blancos (The Whites), which is
  the nickname of the club's city rivals, Real Madrid.
